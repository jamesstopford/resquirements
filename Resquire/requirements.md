I want to make a quick personal software project. I want something with a UI, where I can paste/write-content and have it quickly take that content, put it in a structured text template, and save it with automatic file names in a targeted directory.Specific purpose is to allow me to write a bunch of requirement files, and have LLM Agents work on one at a time.
